    <h2><b>About Course</b></h2>
    <p style="font-size: 130%;">
        This course is taught under subject Full Stack Using Scripting Languages. Basically, in this course we will came across the technology named as Front End Development which is seriously involved in designing the User Interface of the websites using mainly
        HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language), CSS (Cascading Style Sheets), Javascript alongwith jQuery, Bootstrap. In this technology, the focus of developer is only on the front end (as the name suggests) i.e. face of the website / webpage rather than
        focusing on programming part / database management part which all falls under the backend part. From this technology, one can develop starting from a simple webpage of HTML to complex and responsive websites which is designed to be accessed via
        various platform.
